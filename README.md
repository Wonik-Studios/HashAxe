# HashAxe
HashAxe is a CLI utility which can detect blacklisted files by their MD5 hash in a very timely manner. It can be used to remove malicious files, check for the existance of a file when the MD5 hash is known, and to recover lost files when they are moved to an unknown path. HashAxe is written entirely in C#.

This README consists of only installation instructions and documentation of the CLI. For a more in-depth overview of HashAxe, visit https://wonik.info/projects/hashaxe.
