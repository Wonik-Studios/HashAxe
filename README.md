# HashAxe
HashAxe is a CLI utility which can detect blacklisted files by their MD5 hash in a very timely manner. It can be used to remove malicious files, check for the existance of a file when the MD5 hash is known, and to recover lost files when they are moved to an unknown path.

This README consists of only installation instructions and documentation of the CLI. For a more in-depth overview of HashAxe, visit https://wonik.info/projects/hashaxe.
